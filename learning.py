#variables in python
#variable is a container for storing data values
#variables are created when you assign a value to it
#variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set
#variables are case-sensitive
#variable names must start with a letter or underscore character
#variable names can only contain letters, numbers, or underscores
#variable names cannot start with a number
#variable names cannot be a reserved keyword
#variable names should be descriptive and meaningful
#variable names should be in lowercase
#variable names should be separated by underscores
#variable names should not be too long
#variable names should not be too short


x = 5 #x is a variable that stores the value 5
y = "Hello, World!" #y is a variable that stores the string "Hello, World!"
z = 3.14 #z is a variable that stores the float 3.14
a = True #a is a variable that stores the boolean value True
b = None #b is a variable that stores the value None
print(x) #prints the value of x
print(y) #prints the value of y
print(z) #prints the value of z
print(a) #prints the value of a
print(b) #prints the value of b
print(type(x)) #prints the type of x
print(type(y)) #prints the type of y
print(type(z)) #prints the type of z
print(type(a)) #prints the type of a
print(type(b)) #prints the type of b

# lists in python
#lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable
#lists are created using square brackets []
#lists can contain any data type
#lists can contain duplicate values

fruits = ['apple' , 'orange' , 'mango' , 'orange' , 'pawpaw']
print(fruits) #prints the list of fruits 
print(type(fruits)) #prints the type of fruits = list
print(len(fruits)) #prints the length of the list of fruits
print(fruits[0]) #prints the first item in the list of fruits
print(fruits[1]) #prints the second item in the list of fruits
print(fruits[2]) #prints the third item in the list of fruits

#tuples in python
#tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable
#tuples are created using parentheses ()
cars= ('Volvo', 'Mercedes' , 'Honda') #tuple
print(cars) #prints the tuple of cars
print(type(cars)) #prints the type of cars = tuple
print(len(cars)) #prints the length of the tuple of cars
print(cars[0]) #prints the first item in the tuple of cars
print(cars[1]) #prints the second item in the tuple of cars
print(cars[0:2]) #prints the first two items in the tuple of cars

students = ('John', 'Mary' , 'Peter') #tuple

# difference between list and tuple
#lists are mutable (can be changed) while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed) 
#lists are created using square brackets [] while tuples are created using parentheses ()
#lists can contain duplicate values while tuples can also contain duplicate values
#lists can be nested while tuples can also be nested
#lists can be sliced while tuples can also be sliced
#lists can be concatenated while tuples can also be concatenated
#lists can be repeated while tuples can also be repeated
#lists can be iterated while tuples can also be iterated
#lists can be unpacked while tuples can also be unpacked

#Dictionaries in python
#Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs
#Dictionaries are created using curly brackets {}
#Dictionaries can contain any data type
#Dictionaries can contain duplicate keys
